# Call Expressions (From last week)

**This is important!**

When evaluating call expressions,
1. Evaluate the operator
2. Evaluate the operands, left to right
3. Apply the operator to the operands (for built-ins, we don't open a new frame.)
  1. Open a new frame
  2. Bind the formal parameters to the argument values
  3. Evaluate the function body

Do Q1 and Q2

# Lambda Functions

Syntax:
```py
lambda <arguments>: <body>
```

Nested lambda statements (special case of above):
```py
lambda <arguments>: lambda <arguments>: <body>
```

equivalent to

```py
lambda <arguments>: (lambda <arguments>: <body>)
```

so the first lambda statement is really just a lambda that returns another lambda, with this as the body:
```py
(lambda <arguments>: <body>)
```

Do Q3.

# Higher-order Functions

Definition: A **higher order function (HOF)** is a function that manipulates other functions by taking in functions as arguments, returning a function, or both.

```py
def composer(func1, func2):
    """Return a function f, such that f(x) = func1(func2(x))."""
    def f(x):
        return func1(func2(x))
    return f
```

or as you saw in lab, `curry`:

```py
def lambda_curry2(func):
    return lambda arg1: lambda arg2: func(arg1, arg2)
```

or as we commonly see, `add_n`:
```py
>>> def add_n(n):
...    return lambda x: x + n
...
>>> add_one = add_n(1)
>>> add_one(3)
4
```

Why is this powerful?

Why is this powerful?
* It allows us to "remember data" -> "closure".

HOF Warmup! Do Q4.

# Q5: Make Keeper

```py
def make_keeper(n):
    """Returns a function which takes one parameter cond and prints
    out all integers 1..i..n where calling cond(i) returns True.

    >>> def is_even(x):
    ...     # Even numbers have remainder 0 when divided by 2.
    ...     return x % 2 == 0
    >>> make_keeper(5)(is_even)
    2
    4
    """
```

# Q1

```py
def make_keeper(n):
    """Returns a function which takes one parameter cond and prints
    out all integers 1..i..n where calling cond(i) returns True.

    >>> def is_even(x):
    ...     # Even numbers have remainder 0 when divided by 2.
    ...     return x % 2 == 0
    >>> make_keeper(5)(is_even)
    2
    4
    """
    def do_keep(cond):
        i = 1
        while i <= n:
            if cond(i):
                print(i)
            i += 1
    return do_keep
```

# Currying

Think of this as "delayed execution". With currying, we can 'postpone execution' by taking in the arguments of a function separately, without them all needing to be passed in at the same time.

```py
>>> def curried_pow(x):
        def h(y):
            return pow(x, y)
        return h

>>> curried_pow(2)(3)
8
```

Do Q6.

# Exam Prep

Poll time! How are we feeling about Environment Diagrams? Code-writing?

---

# HOF Diagram Practice

```py
n = 7

def f(x):
    n = 8
    return x + 1

def g(x):
    n = 9
    def h():
        return x + 1
    return h

def f(f, x):
    return f(x + n)

f = f(g, n)
g = (lambda y: y())(f)
```

# YesNo (Not on worksheet, but you asked for it :D)

```py
def yes(no):
    yes = "no"
    return no

no = "no"

def no(no):
    return no + yes(no)

yes = yes(yes)(no)("ok")
```

# Match Maker

```py
Solution
def match_k(k):
    """ Return a function that checks if digits k apart match

    >>> match_k(2)(1010)
    True
    >>> match_k(2)(2010)
    False
    >>> match_k(1)(1010)
    False
    >>> match_k(1)(1)
